The MYM landing page was made with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. This is only a landing page, and each link doesn't actually redirect. Only the navigation links work. The website's main features include:

1. An navigation menu and bar that smooth-scrolls to the main sections of the landing page.
2. An animated hero section with links to social media pages.
3. A services section that links to each specific service.
4. A projects section that links to recent project case studies.
5. A contact section with a call-to-action button that links to a form.
